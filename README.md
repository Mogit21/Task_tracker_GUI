1. Environment Setup
   
   python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install nicegui sqlalchemy






python main.py

Then visit: http://localhost:8080





python seed_categories.py
This script inserts predefined categories into your SQLite database so that your task UI has valid options to choose from when creating tasks.

When should I run this?
Only once ‚Äî after your database is initialized but before using the UI. If you run it again, it won‚Äôt create duplicates because of the if not exists check.

üì¶ controllers.py: When to Use It
Right now, all the logic (e.g., saving tasks, refreshing lists) is inside your UI code (task_table.py). This works, but as your app grows, that logic might get messy.

You can move business logic to controllers.py to:

‚úÖ Keep UI code clean
‚úÖ Make logic reusable (e.g., for future API or CLI use)
‚úÖ Make unit testing easier
